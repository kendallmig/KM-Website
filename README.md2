The negative effects of trash in the ocean are numerous and far-reaching. Marine litter, such as plastic bags, bottles, and fishing nets, pose a significant threat to marine life, as they can entangle, suffocate, or ingest marine animals. This not only causes immense suffering for individual animals, but also disrupts the balance of entire ecosystems. Additionally, ocean trash can also harm human health by contaminating seafood and other food sources with toxins and pollutants. The accumulation of trash in the ocean can also lead to physical and economic damage, such as by clogging waterways, causing flooding, and interfering with tourism and recreational activities. Furthermore, plastic waste can persist in the environment for centuries, releasing harmful chemicals and microplastics that can harm wildlife and humans alike. The negative impacts of ocean trash highlight the urgent need for increased efforts to prevent, reduce, and properly manage waste.
