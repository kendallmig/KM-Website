## Why does it matter?

The negative effects of trash in the ocean are numerous and far-reaching. Marine litter, such as plastic bags, bottles, and fishing nets, pose a significant threat to marine life, as they can entangle, suffocate, or ingest marine animals. This not only causes immense suffering for individual animals, but also disrupts the balance of entire ecosystems. Additionally, ocean trash can also harm human health by contaminating seafood and other food sources with toxins and pollutants. The accumulation of trash in the ocean can also lead to physical and economic damage, such as by clogging waterways, causing flooding, and interfering with tourism and recreational activities. Furthermore, plastic waste can persist in the environment for centuries, releasing harmful chemicals and microplastics that can harm wildlife and humans alike. The negative impacts of ocean trash highlight the urgent need for increased efforts to prevent, reduce, and properly manage waste.

## Quantity of Trash in the Ocean

It is difficult to estimate exactly how much trash is in the ocean, as a significant amount of it is not visible or has sunk to the ocean floor. However, studies and research have shown that there are currently millions of tons of trash and debris in the world's oceans, with an estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic waste alone entering the ocean each year. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a concentration of marine debris in the Pacific Ocean, is estimated to contain over 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic and span an area twice the size of Texas. The accumulation of trash in the ocean has become a major environmental issue, threatening marine life and ecosystems, human health, and the global economy.

## Artificial Intelligence to Save our Planet?

Using AlexNet and machine learning algorithms to detect and separate trash and living animals in the ocean is a promising application of artificial intelligence for marine conservation. AlexNet, with its ability to accurately classify images and recognize fine-grained details, can be trained on a large dataset of underwater images to differentiate between various types of marine debris and living organisms. The machine learning algorithms can then be used to automatically detect and segment objects in the images, allowing for the identification and separation of trash and living animals. This can be a useful tool for researchers, conservationists, and government agencies, who can use the information to better understand the distribution and impact of marine debris on marine life, and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the problem. Furthermore, the use of AI technology for ocean conservation can help reduce the reliance on human labor, which can be time-consuming and costly, while also increasing the accuracy and speed of data processing.
