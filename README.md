The number of types of wildflowers in the U.S. is difficult to determine with certainty as it varies depending on how "wildflower" is defined and counted. However, it is estimated that there are over 17,000 species of vascular plants, which include wildflowers, in the United States. This number is constantly changing as new species are discovered and taxonomy is updated. The U.S. is home to a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems, from deserts and grasslands to forests and wetlands, each of which supports its own unique set of wildflowers. Therefore, the actual number of wildflower species in the U.S. is likely much higher than the estimated number of vascular plants.
